# Chinuk Wawa - XKB integration (Linux)

Chinuk Wawa is an Indigenous trade language once extensively used throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is taught in an immersive classroom setting by the [Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde](https://www.grandronde.org/services/education/shawash-ili%CA%94i-skul/). Remote learning and academic accreditation for Chinuk Wawa is available through [Lane Community College](https://www.lanecc.edu/programs-academics/academic-departments/humanities-division/language-studies-department/chinuk-wawa).

This installs a Chinuk Wawa custom keyboard onto most Linux distributions without the need of additional software.

## Installation

1. Open a terminal and run the following command. You will need the root password to install a single text file to your Linux system.

```
sudo curl -o /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgesense/chinuk-wawa-custom-keyboard/refs/heads/main/custom"
```

2. Activate the layout on your desktop via the keyboard settings by selecting "A user-defined custom Layout."

Here's an example for KDE Plasma. You may also need to add an additional keyboard layout for toggling between keyboards.

Here's an example for Gnome. This should also work for any other window manager that borrows x components.

![add keyboard layout](https://github.com/bridgesense/chinuk-wawa-custom-keyboard/blob/main/media/Gnome-01.jpeg?raw=true)

Type "Custom" in the search bar below the menu, then select "Other".

Select "A user-defined custom Layout."

3. Toggle the keyboard layout using the taskbar or the keyboard shortcut appropriate to your Linux window manager.

In KDE the shortcut is Meta+Alt+k.

In Gnome the shortcut is Meta+Spacebar.

### Notes

Although this keyboard works in most settings, xkb only allows the binding of one Unicode character to a single key. The letters `q̓`, `t̓`, `x̣`, and `ƛ̓` do not have a single Unicode equivalent. To use these characters it is necessary to type the letter twice, once in standard state and once in shift state.

For example to get the letter `x̣`, type x and then type shift+x.

One advantage to the xkb system is that the keyboard is available to all applications, including the terminal.

### KDE Work-around

On newer versions of KDE, the selected keyboard will not be retained after restarting the system due to [bug #442942](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=442942). Unfortunately, the only solution is to add the keyboard layout back in after each restart of KDE.
